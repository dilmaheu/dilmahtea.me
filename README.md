# Dilmah - A cup of kindness

32 years ago, when Merrill J Fernando founded Dilmah, he believed that a tea cup can solve problems of the mankind. Whether they were problems between nations, between businesses, even in families between husbands & wives, tea has been a soothing balm that has helped their solution. The simple act of pouring a cup of tea is, in itself, an ice-breaker, providing pleasurable anticipation of the goodness that is to follow.

And today, we believe that the same cup of tea that can solve problems among nations, businesses and families can break the loneliness in people. So, we look forward to building on a purposeful message with a new platform: A cup of kindness- to fight loneliness in every little possible way we can.

## What is A cup of kindness?

Our effort is to encourage every one of you to get closer to the people around you.

While the simple act of pouring tea has been an ice breaker and a great way to reconnect for centuries, share your tea with friends you’ve not talked to in a long while, go back to that neighbour you see every day but has never spoken a word with, talk to those people who are living alone, talk to someone who has told you that they are feeling lonely or talk to that friend with whom you’ve fallen out.

At the end of the day, what matters is shifting back to people, letting them know that you care.

## Open source & A cup of kindness

The simple act of sharing a piece of code is, in itself, an invitation, providing a glimpse into the potential that can be unlocked.
We believe by sharing code and participating in open source software platforms can bridge technological gaps and foster collaborations. It will also promote community spirit and shared growth.
