Title: Documentation
---

All of the code we write must be descriptive enough that a programmer/developer can tell what it does after reading it. However, if the code fails to adequately describe the purpose, proper comments should be added.

However, comments and descriptive code aren't enough to explain the functionalities of a larger concept. In such cases, we should document the concept thoroughly.

All the documentation files are written in _Markdown_ and stored inside the `docs` directory. We follow the following folder structure for documentation:

- **docs/basics\*.md**: Basics
- **docs/guides/\*.md**: Guides
- **docs/tutorials/\*.md**: Tutorials

Based on the type of the documentation you want to create or update, follow the above folder structure. Also, make sure the index is updated.
