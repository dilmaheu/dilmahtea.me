Title: Documentation
---

We must try to write descriptive code that explains itself. If the code itself isn't enough to explain what it does, we should add comments to the code so that it becomes easier to understand.

However, comments and descriptive code aren't enough to explain the functionalities of a larger concept. In such cases, we should document the concept thoroughly.

All the documentation files are written in _Markdown_ and stored inside the `docs` directory. We follow the following folder structure for documentation:

- **docs/basics\*.md**: Basics
- **docs/guides/\*.md**: Guides
- **docs/recipies/\*.md**: Recipies

Based on the type of the documentation you want to create or update, follow the above folder structure. Also, make sure the index is updated.
